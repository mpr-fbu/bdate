So far, all the projects developed during the three weeks of CodePath training were amazing and reflected a lot of my expectations for FBU. Overall, I am personally proud of the quality of my work and my learning curve, especially because that for the last two projects I could build the projects with a greater degree of independence, without following the CodePath walkthrough/tutorials  closely. Although I already expected it, I was a little overwhelmed with the amount of information that I had to absorb in these first weeks, especially because I wasn't that experienced in Java.
I felt like I was pretty productive, despite noticing that I lost track of what I had to do more easily as I steered away from the CodePath guides. One thought led to another and when I realized I was thinking about really high level features without having figured out the simplest things. Writing clear goals and deadlines helps my thought process, though. I believe I should do that more in the upcoming weeks, given we now have to build a project from scratch with no hand-holding.
One nice aspect of these first three weeks is that I noticed I learned a lot when I had to explain some Android programming concepts to other people in FBU. That really helped me consolidate what I had studied.
